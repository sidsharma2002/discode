# DISCODE

### PROBLEM
Their are many Students are not able to ask their **silly doubts** worrying about what others would think,
This creates an impact on their studies and also demotivates them.

### SOLUTION
After some brainstorming and coding I came up with a chat app that is very simple in UI.
What sets it apart is that when a user sends a message others are not able to see the **sender's name**.
Hence now the user should have no hesitation in asking any doubt from their peers.

### TECHNOLOGY USED
Discode is a firebase oriented app that means it used firebase service as its main component
The data is fetched from Firestore and is viewed to the user using Firestore-recyclerview.
